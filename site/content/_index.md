    Iain-Gordon Macfarlane is a multi-instrumentalist who is equally at home
    playing and writing traditional tunes and melodies as improvising to a more
    contemporary sound. 


    His principal instruments are fiddle and guitar and he has an impressive
    range of self-penned songs, tunes and ideas, ready for recording. Originally
    from Ullapool, he graduated from Plockton Music School where he was taught
    by namesake and Highland fiddle extraordinaire, Iain Macfarlane. Since then
    he has completed work as a session musician, recording with artists such as
    Claire Campbell on her album ‘Abagail Grey’ and Simon Kempstonon his album
    ‘Fine Line’.
